## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

if rounded_result > 0:
    print(f"TSLA: +{rounded_result}")

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

    news_file.write(pretty_data_news)
with open('data_news.json', 'r') as news_file:
    news_data = json.load(news_file)

for news in news_data['articles'][:3]:
    print(f'HEADLINE: {news["title"]}\n Description: {news["description"]}')
